# Super-Shop-Management
## C++ Supermarket Management System

This project is a C++ program that simulates a supermarket management system which was manily created as a project for out software development course. It provides functionalities for managing inventory, creating shopping carts, processing bills, and (optionally) tracking customer information.

**Features:**

- **Inventory Management:**
    - Add, remove, update, and search for products.
    - Maintain a comprehensive inventory list with details like ID, name, price, and quantity.
- **Shopping Cart:**
    - Add, remove, and adjust the quantity of items in a shopping cart.
    - Calculate the total cost of items based on current prices and chosen quantities.
- **Billing System:**
    - Simulate the checkout process, presenting a detailed list of cart items and their costs.
    - Offer the ability to apply discounts (coupons, loyalty points - optional) and calculate the final bill amount.
- **User Interface:**
    - Provide a user-friendly interface (console-based or GUI) for interacting with the system.
    - Create a clear menu-driven structure for easy navigation and task execution.
- **(Optional) Customer Management:**
    - Implement customer accounts with login/registration functionality.
    - Track purchase history and offer loyalty programs to incentivize repeat customers (optional).
- **(Optional) Reporting:**
    - Generate reports on sales, revenue, and inventory levels by date range or product category.
    - Provide data for analysis and decision-making (e.g., identifying best-selling items, reordering low-stock products).

**Getting Started:**

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   Use `git clone https://github.com/titan000001/Super-Shop-Management.git` to clone this repository to your local machine.

2. **Prerequisites:**

   - A C++ compiler (e.g., GCC, Clang)
   - (Optional) A C++ GUI library (e.g., FLTK, Qt) if you choose to implement a GUI interface

3. **Build and Run:**

   **Console-based interface:**

   - Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
   - Compile the code using your C++ compiler (e.g., `g++ main.cpp -o supermarket`).
   - Run the program by executing the compiled binary (e.g., `./supermarket`).

   **GUI interface (if applicable):**

   - Follow the specific build instructions for your chosen GUI library.
   - Run the compiled executable to launch the program.

**Contributing:**

We welcome contributions to this project! Feel free to fork the repository, make changes, and submit pull requests. Please ensure your code adheres to good C++ coding practices and includes clear comments.


**Future Enhancements(Optional):**

- Bulk product editing
- User roles (admin vs. cashier)
- Discount rules (coupons, loyalty points)
- Product categorization
- Search by product category
- Graphical reports
- Payment gateway simulation (for a more realistic experience)
- Database integration for data persistence
